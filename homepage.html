<h1>In The Beginning!</h1> 

<p> Home consoles have become a regular feature in the American household, even those who would not call themselves gamers will admit to some familiarity with what an Xbox, Playstation, or a Wii is. As of 2011, 70% of households own some kind of gaming console and the industry earned over $24 billion dollars in revenue.

<br><br>Many of the consoles on display are probably not very familiar to most people even those who consider themselves videogame fans. Part of the reason comes from the fact that the videogame industry suffered a great crash in the early 80's which it still technically has never truly recovered from. Certainly not in the American console production side of it. 

<br><br>What caused the crash? Like anything there were many factors that went into it, but one of the biggest was the proliferation of third-party software companies creating games. The first of these companies was Activision, originally formed by disgruntled Atari employees, in 1979 which lead the way for many other companies to try to crash in on the videogame craze. Companies like Parker Brothers and even Quaker Oats would try to get a cut of the profit from this new media. This would lead to a proliferation of cheap, poorly made games which flooded the market and contributed to the crash.

<br><br>Like today the video game industry particularly its consoles depended heavily on good marketing for their success. Here are just a few examples of these advertisements extolling for their time superior graphics and engaging gameplay.</p>
